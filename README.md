# OANDA_BOT_PYTHON

This one is fully working, probably some bug. I am leaving the whole day running and so far ok.

Even if I interrupt and run again still managing all trades open and running the plan

Need to write the plan and select the indicators-strategy as added. 

Anyone can add conditions to the strategy and indicators to run any new strategy.
